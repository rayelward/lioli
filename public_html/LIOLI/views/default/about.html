<DIV class="about_text">
<p>LIOLI (love it or leave it) is an online forum for anonymously asking for relationship advice. Users can submit a brief statement about their relationship and the community can vote their opinion. LIOLI is 100% anonymous with a unique serial number system for users.</p> 
<p>Relationships can be complicated or confusing and it is hard to ask close friends or loved ones for advice. LIOLI provides a status quo perspective on dating issues.</p>
<p>You will benefit from this application by passing time in the monotony of everyday life voyeuristically enjoying tales of anonymous peopleâ€™s relationship troubles.  Even more importantly this will make people feel better about their own relationships, or conversely make them feel worse about their current relationship and give them the courage to get out of something that may be bad for them.</p>
